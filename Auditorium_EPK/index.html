								<p><h2>Auditorium</h2> is Spencer Berger. Berger began performing at the age of nine as a
								member of The Metropolitan Opera’s Children’s Chorus, singing onstage with such
								golden-throated legends as Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. His selfreleased
								2011 debut album (Be Brave) and 2012 EP (Nights Worth Living)
								dropped jaws thanks to Berger's goosebump-inducing voice and his gift for crafting
								lush, genre-defying arrangements that framed his instant-earworm melodies. Now,
							 	Berger has returned with his second LP, The First Music — grand in scope (15
								songs) yet tightly constructed (33 minutes), it pulls off a magic trick by unearthing
								beauty and hope in some of life's darkest, most harrowing corners.</span></p>
								<p>Berger describes the The First Music as “a hunt for answers to unanswerable
								questions.” While constructing it, Berger drew on a mix of personal tragedy (the
								death of a close friend), family history (many of his relatives were either
								imprisoned or killed during the Holocaust), vivid childhood memories, and current
								worldwide events. At the album’s core lurks a theme that Berger admits terrified
								him: “I wanted to confront the reality of my eventual death.
								<p>The weight of the project crept into Berger’s performance on the album. While
								recording vocals for the song “The Night Before I Turned Thirteen,” Berger
								frequently had to stop because he was too overwhelmed. “I’ve always been one of
								those guys who’s pretty good at holding in the tears,” says Berger. “But that song
								forced me to think about some particularly horrible things that were done to a
								relative of mine at the hands of the Nazis. And I found it almost impossible to get
								through a full take without breaking.”</p>
								<p>Recording and mixing for over 200 consecutive nights in his Los Angeles
								apartment — and performing all instruments and vocals himself — Berger
								concedes that the process was all-consuming. While the instrumentation itself is
								minimalistic (limited mostly to acoustic & electric guitars, bass, and piano, with
								occasional percussion), Berger’s arrangements are intricately layered; the vocals
								alone were a gargantuan undertaking, requiring hundreds of hours to capture the
								sumptuous harmonies that populate the songs.</P>
								<p>Despite the darkness of much of its subject matter, the album is infused with an
								unshakable sense of joy and possibility. Berger’s hunt for answers often leads him
								into frightening territory, but he defies expectations by finding gratitude,
								compassion, and wonder in the midst of agony, confusion, and loss. In the song
								“My Uncle’s Tree,” he sings:</p>
								<p><center><i>I’ve heard said that sadness is the hardest thing to bend</i></center>
								<center><i>But I think hope is harder</i></center>
								<center><i>It’s the one thing I can’t end</i></center></p>
								
								<p>Those lines embody the spirit of The First Music; a work that stares unflinchingly
								into the void, examining the lowest points of human experience, while remaining
								defiantly, ferociously hopeful.</p>
